Code to simulate the mathematical model of the controlled circulation written by A Kennard, Z Ahmad, K C Peskin and K Ong.

This branch is an archive of the repository to store the now deprecated Matlab code. The code to simulate the 2021 controller in Matlab is located in the folder matlab_controller_2021. The folder crtl contains code to simulate the 2017 uncontrolled and controlled model.

The Matlab code is deprecated. Code to simulate the controlled model of the steady state circulation can be found in steady_state. Code to simulate the ODE model is currently under development in its own branch.

This code requires python 3 and the packages listed in the requirements.txt file.
