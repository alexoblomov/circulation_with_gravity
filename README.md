Code to simulate the mathematical model of the controlled circulation written by C Peskin, A Kennard and Z Ahmad.

The Matlab code is deprecated. Code to simulate the controlled model of the steady state circulation can be found in python_model/steady_state. Code to simulate the ODE model is currently under development in its own branch.

This code requires python 3 and the packages listed in the requirements.txt file.
